I built a boolean satisfiability solver that takes a set of variables and connectives in CNF and returns either a satisfying assignment that would make the CNF sentence true or determines that no satisfying assignment is possiblev using the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm or DPLL algorithm.
